# ArboxAssignment

I did all the exercises including the nonmandatory ones.

From what I understood, 4d wanted me to calculate the total time and then display it next to the elevator button (it will be displayed in PINK on the far right once the elevator arrives).

Whereas 7 wanted me to display a stopwatch counting the time (in real-time) until the elevator arrives (displayed in RED next to the elevator buttons).

Please note, that for exercises 8 & 9 I used windows Prompt() method, so when you run the HTML 2 prompts will pop up asking for number of elevators and then number of floors. 

Also, the requirement that the elevator will be delayed for 2 seconds once it had reached the floor can be seen from the time the PINK time appears and the real-time stopwatch stops until it ends when the button will become green (and undisabled) and timers will be reset as well.
